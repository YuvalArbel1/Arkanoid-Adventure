# Arkanoid Adventure

![Arkanoid Adventure Banner](openingVideo.mp4)

Welcome to the **Arkanoid Adventure** repository! This project was born from an engaging Object-Oriented Programming course at Bar Ilan University. Brace yourself for a thrilling rendition of the classic Arkanoid game, complete with multiple levels of increasing difficulty, all wrapped in a user-friendly GUI environment.

## Project Overview

Dive into the culmination of a 7-part assignment, a testament to my journey through BIU's second semester. Diverging from the norm, this project employs a unique single-thread approach—an unconventional choice for games of this kind. Rather than relying on Java GUI Built-In objects, I've crafted a bespoke GUI implementation that resides within this repository.

At its core, this project showcases a Java-based Arkanoid game—a showcase of my comprehensive grasp of Object-Oriented Programming principles, nurtured throughout my bachelor's degree. This innovative iteration introduces diverse levels of escalating complexity, tailored for an engaging GUI-driven experience. Every aspect of this project was crafted with the powerful Intellij IDEA Ultimate IDE, intertwined with the bedrock of Object-Oriented Programming:

* Leveraging the power of polymorphism and inheritance.
* Embracing crucial design patterns like Observer, Builder, and more.
* Harnessing an array of generic collections and data structures, including linked lists and arraylists.
* Mastery of GUI development intricacies.

## Architectural Elegance

### Builder Design Symphony

At the heart of design patterns, the Builder design assumes center stage, orchestrating the gradual composition of diverse game objects. Each builder class meticulously crafts specific objects, ensuring flexibility and user-friendliness. This approach maintains an immaculate and well-structured codebase, facilitating property adjustments during construction.

### Symphony of Strategy

Seamlessly woven into the project's fabric, the strategy design pattern orchestrates distinct block placement and coloring behaviors in the initial game level. This infusion of strategies empowers the project to create levels adorned with distinct characteristics without compromising the core game logic.

### Decorator Dance

Like an intricate dance, the decorator design pattern bestows fresh functionalities upon existing Animation objects. The WaitingForKeyPressDecorator class takes the stage as the project's decorator virtuoso, flanked by the PauseScreen and KeyPressStoppableAnimation components. This ballet of decorators empowers seamless incorporation of functionalities while maintaining an elegant and maintainable codebase.

### Observer Overture

The Observer design pattern forms an enchanting overture, skillfully managing events triggered by various game objects. Game objects assume the role of Observables, while listener classes embody the Observers. These listeners gracefully respond to events initiated by game objects, whether it's removing blocks or balls, updating scores, and more. The Observer pattern paints a flexible and modular code tableau, easily accommodating new listeners without affecting the core game objects.

## Essential Ensemble

* Operating Systems: Windows / Linux / macOS
* Git
* Keyboard equipped with: Spacebar (for pausing), "P" button, and arrow keys.

## Installation and Grand Premiere

To set the stage for this gaming spectacle:

1. Securely grasp the "ArkanoidAdventure.jar" from the release section.
2. Initiate the spectacle by unveiling the curtains on the downloaded JAR file, commencing an immersive gaming escapade.

## Unveiling the Gameplay Symphony

* Gently wield the 'Left' and 'Right' arrow keys to maneuver the paddle.
* Gracefully choreograph a pause by enacting the 'p' key.
* Restore the gameplay's crescendo by invoking the 'Space' key.
* Immerse yourself in the quest to dismantle all blocks, advancing through the levels toward triumph.

Immerse yourself in this enchanting journey of **Arkanoid Adventure** a harmonious symphony of classic gameplay and modern design principles. Unleash your skills, transcend levels, and bask in the euphoria of victory!
